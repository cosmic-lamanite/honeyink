A Deseret Typewriter Font

this font was made to simulate a typewriter, 
this can be used to write "documents" in deseret script.

this font was heavily inspired by JRM Typewriter Font, 
although i dont intend on comercialize this font, i have taken off all latin and cyrillic
ultimately turning Honey Ink independent from JRM. if any problem, contact me via email on my profile.
