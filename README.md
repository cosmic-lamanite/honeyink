this font was made to simulate a typewriter, 
this can be used to write "documents" in deseret script.

this font was heavily inspired by JMH Typewriter Font, 
although i dont intend on comercialize this font, i have taken off all latin and cyrillic
ultimately turning Honey Ink independent from JRM. if any problem, contact me via email on my profile.

Here are some examples of Honey Ink:

Of course, any suggestions are welcome!
